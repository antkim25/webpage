        <li>About the meme:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Its first appearance was in "It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia", which grew the song's popularity on the internet.</li>
                <li>Then the creator of 4chan created a word filter that changed the word "egg to duck".</li>
                <li>Then, someone made a post about an eggroll, which was changed to duckroll, which became a small meme.</li>
                <li>People made hyperlinks that you would click on, expecting something different, which led you to the duckroll meme image.</li>
                <li>The first trailer for Grand Theft Auto IV came out.</li>
                <li>People made fake hyperlinks to this, which actually sent people to the Never Gonna Give You Up music video.</li>
                <li>This started <em>rickrolling</em>, and the meme got bigger, even helping the music video get to <strong>1 billion</strong> views!</li>
            </ul>
